            The Law of Pay Yourself First is a simple but revolutionary shift in financial mindset. Most people earn money, pay all their bills and expenses, and then try to save whatever is left overâ€”which is often nothing. This law flips the script: as soon as you receive your income, the very first "bill" you pay is to your future self by transferring a set amount into your savings or investment accounts. You then live on the rest. This guarantees that you are always saving and building wealth.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-text mb-3">The Law in Action</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
            <li>
                <strong>Automated Savings:</strong> Setting up an automatic transfer from your checking account to your savings account on payday is the perfect execution of this law. It happens without any willpower or discipline required from you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Retirement Contributions:</strong> A 401(k) or similar workplace retirement plan where contributions are deducted from your paycheck before you even see it is a powerful application of paying yourself first.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Adapting Your Lifestyle:</strong> By removing your savings from your spendable income first, you naturally adjust your lifestyle to fit the remaining amount, forcing you to live within your means.

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Determine Your Savings Goal:</strong> Decide on a percentage of your income you want to save (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%). If you're just starting, even 1% is better than nothing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automate the Transfer:</strong> Go to your bank's website and set up a recurring, automatic transfer from your checking account to a separate savings or investment account. Schedule this transfer for payday.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Make It Hard to Access:</strong> Keep your savings in a separate account, ideally at a different bank, to reduce the temptation to dip into it for non-emergencies.
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>Increase it Over Time:</strong> Every time you get a raise or pay off a debt, increase the amount you are automatically saving.
