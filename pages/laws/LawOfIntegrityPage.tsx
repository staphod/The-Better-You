            The Law of Integrity states that true peace of mind and self-respect come from the perfect alignment of your values, thoughts, and actions. The word "integrity" comes from the same root as "integer," meaning whole or complete. A person of integrity is wholeâ€”there is no gap between the person they claim to be and the person they are in their actions. This internal consistency is the bedrock of character.

            <li>
                <strong>Walking the Talk:</strong> A manager with integrity doesn't just talk about the company's values; they live them, especially when it's difficult.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Honesty Under Pressure:</strong> A person of integrity will tell the truth even when a lie would be easier or more profitable.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Keeping Promises to Yourself:</strong> Integrity is not just about how you treat others; it's also about honoring the commitments you make to yourself, like sticking to a diet or a personal goal.

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Clarify Your Values:</strong> You cannot live in alignment with your values if you don't know what they are. Take the time to write down the principles that are most important to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Listen to Your Conscience:</strong> Your conscience is your internal integrity compass. If an action feels wrong, it probably is. Learn to trust that inner voice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Be the Same Person in All Situations:</strong> Strive to be the same person when you are with your boss, your family, or completely alone. Integrity means being whole and consistent, not wearing different masks for different audiences.
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>Choose the Hard Right Over the Easy Wrong:</strong> In moments of decision, consciously choose the path that aligns with your values, even if it requires more effort or short-term sacrifice (see Law of Right Action).
