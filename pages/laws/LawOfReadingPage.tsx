            The Law of Reading states that a daily habit of reading is the most effective and efficient way to acquire new knowledge, gain different perspectives, and learn from the greatest minds in history. Books are a condensed source of wisdom, offering years of experience and research in a matter of hours. By making reading a non-negotiable part of your life, you tap into a limitless well of ideas that can accelerate your personal and professional growth.

            <li>
                <strong>Warren Buffett:</strong> The legendary investor famously spends up to 80% of his day reading. He attributes his success to this constant accumulation of knowledge, which allows him to make better-informed decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Empathy and Understanding:</strong> Reading fiction allows you to step into the minds and lives of others, fostering empathy and a deeper understanding of the human condition.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Problem Solving:</strong> When you're facing a challenge, it's highly likely that someone has already faced and overcome a similar problem and written about it. Reading allows you to learn from their mistakes and successes without having to make them all yourself.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-text mb-3">How to Build a Reading Habit</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Start Small:</strong> Don't try to read a book a day. Start with a goal of reading just one page, or for five minutes, every day. The goal is to build the habit first (see Law of Accumulation).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Schedule It:</strong> Treat reading like an important appointment. Block out time in your calendar, whether it's first thing in the morning, during your lunch break, or before bed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Always Carry a Book:</strong> Have a physical book, e-book, or audiobook with you at all times. You can turn "dead time" (waiting in line, commuting) into productive reading time.
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>Quit Books You Don't Enjoy:</strong> Life is too short to finish bad books. If a book isn't grabbing you after 50-100 pages, give yourself permission to quit and find one that does. The goal is to love reading, not to see it as a chore.
