          <p>
            CBT is based on a simple but powerful idea: your <strong>thoughts</strong>, <strong>feelings</strong>, and <strong>behaviors</strong> are interconnected. A negative thought can lead to a negative feeling, which in turn can lead to a negative behavior. This creates a cycle that can be difficult to break.
          </p>
           <div className="text-center my-6 font-semibold">
            <p>Thought ("I'm a failure") &rarr; Feeling (Sadness, hopelessness) &rarr; Behavior (Staying in bed, avoiding tasks)</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The good news is that you can intervene in this cycle. By learning to identify and challenge your unhelpful thoughts, you can change how you feel and what you do. CBT gives you the tools to become the architect of your own mind.

          <p>Cognitive distortions are irrational, automatic thought patterns that can lead to anxiety and depression. Learning to spot them is the first step. Here are some of the most common ones:</p>
          <div className="space-y-4 mt-4">
            {cognitiveDistortions.map(d => (
              <div key={d.name} className="p-4 bg-slate-50 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">
                <h4 className="font-bold text-brand-text">{d.name}</h4>
                <p className="text-sm">{d.description}</p>
                <p className="text-sm italic text-slate-500 mt-2">{d.example}</p>
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-text mb-3">How to Challenge a Negative Thought</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Identify the Automatic Thought:</strong> When you feel a sudden negative emotion, ask yourself: "What was just going through my mind?" Write the thought down exactly as it occurred.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Identify the Distortion:</strong> Look at the list above. Which cognitive distortion(s) are at play in your thought? Naming it helps you see it as a pattern, not a fact.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Examine the Evidence:</strong> Challenge the thought like a detective. Ask questions: "What is the evidence that this thought is true? What is the evidence against it? Is there a more balanced way of looking at this?"
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>Create a Balanced, Alternative Thought:</strong> Based on your evidence, write a more rational and compassionate response to the automatic thought. It doesn't have to be overly positive, just more realistic.
            </li>
          </ol>
           <p className="mt-4"><strong>Example:</strong> Your automatic thought is, "I messed up that presentation, I'm so incompetent." You identify this as All-or-Nothing thinking. You examine the evidence: "One part was shaky, but the other parts went well and I got positive feedback on my data." Your new, balanced thought could be: "I was nervous and made a few mistakes, but I prepared well and delivered most of the presentation effectively. I can learn from this and do even better next time."</p>
